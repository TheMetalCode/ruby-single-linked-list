# Ruby Single Linked List Implementation

Interview practice, basically.

## Dev Setup, If You'd Like to See This Work

Prerequisites: [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/rvm/install). There is a way to install this on Windows if you read for long enough, but this otherwise assumes a OSX or Linux environment.

Alternative (especially for Windows): Use [Ruby Installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) to get Ruby 2.4.0

Once you have Ruby on your machine some how some way, clone this repo, then:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
gem install rubygems-bundler
gem regenerate_binstubs
```

Then you can run the tests and the Rubocop code quality checker:

```
rake
```
